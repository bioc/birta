  abstract = {The recent advent of high-throughput microarray data has enabled the
	global analysis of the transcriptome, driving the development and
	application of computational approaches to study transcriptional
	regulation on the genome scale, by reconstructing in silico the regulatory
	interactions of the gene network. Although there are many in-depth
	reviews of such 'reverse-engineering' methodologies, most have focused
	on the practical aspect of data mining, and few on the biological
	problem and the biological relevance of the methodology. Therefore,
	in this review, from a biological perspective, we used a set of yeast
	microarray data as a working example, to evaluate the fundamental
	assumptions implicit in associating transcription factor (TF)-target
	gene expression levels and estimating TFs' activity, and further
	explore cooperative models. Finally we confirm that the detailed
	transcription mechanism is overly-complex for expression data alone
	to reveal, nevertheless, future network reconstruction studies could
	benefit from the incorporation of context-specific information, the
	modeling of multiple layers of regulation (e.g. micro-RNA), or the
	development of approaches for context-dependent analysis, to uncover
	the mechanisms of gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Reverse engineering bioinformatic procedures applied to high-throughput
	experimental data have become instrumental in generating new hypotheses
	about molecular regulatory mechanisms. This has been particularly
	the case for gene expression microarray data, where a large number
	of statistical and computational methodologies have been developed
	in order to assist in building network models of transcriptional
	regulation. A major challenge faced by every different procedure
	is that the number of available samples n for estimating the network
	model is much smaller than the number of genes p forming the system
	under study. This compromises many of the assumptions on which the
	statistics of the methods rely, often leading to unstable performance
	figures. In this work, we apply a recently developed novel methodology
	based in the so-called q-order limited partial correlation graphs,
	qp-graphs, which is specifically tailored towards molecular network
	discovery from microarray expression data with p >> n. Using experimental
	and functional annotation data from Escherichia coli, here we show
	how qp-graphs yield more stable performance figures than other state-of-the-art
	methods when the ratio of genes to experiments exceeds one order
	of magnitude. More importantly, we also show that the better performance
	of the qp-graph method on such a gene-to-sample ratio has a decisive
	impact on the functional coherence of the reverse-engineered transcriptional
	regulatory modules and becomes crucial in such a challenging situation
	in order to enable the discovery of a network of reasonable confidence
	that includes a substantial number of genes relevant to the essayed
	conditions. An R package, called qpgraph implementing this method
	is part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded from (www.bioconductor.org).
	A parallel standalone version for the most computationally expensive
	calculations is available from (http://functionalgenomics.upf.xsedu/qpgraph).},

	906 genes in the reconstructed metabolic network. This model is able
	not only to predict the outcomes of high-throughput growth phenotyping
	and gene expression experiments, but also to indicate knowledge gaps
	and identify previously unknown components and interactions in the

  abstract = {Theoretical efforts to understand the regulation of gene expression
	are traditionally centered around the identification of transcription
	factor binding sites at specific DNA positions. More recently these
	efforts have been supplemented by experimental data for relative
	binding affinities of proteins to longer intergenic sequences. The
	question arises to what extent these two approaches converge. In
	this paper, we adopt a physical binding model to predict the relative
	binding affinity of a transcription factor for a given sequence.We
	find that a significant fraction of genome-wide binding data in yeast
	can be accounted for by simple count matrices and a physical model
	with only two parameters. We demonstrate that our approach is both
	conceptually and practically more powerful than traditional methods,
	which require selection of a cutoff. Our analysis yields biologically
	meaningful parameters, suitable for predicting relative binding affinities
	in the absence of experimental binding data.The C source code for
